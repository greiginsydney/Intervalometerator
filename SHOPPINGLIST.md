# Shopping List

All components were sourced in Sydney, Australia through 2023. We won't anticipate you'll have too many problems sourcing these items.

Notes:
- All pricing shown here is approximate, and excludes shipping costs.
- The totals reflect the unit price and don't take into account that some merchants require you to purchase more than 1.
- All Element 14 links should readily translate to Avnet and Farnell links for other markets. (They're the same company).

#### DC  Power Coupler to suit

Aka a "fake battery". We cut off the USB plugs, stripped the cable and terminated it directly to the matching plug for the PCB-mounted socket. If your camera has an auxiliary power input this coupler won't be necessary - substitute a suitable plug and cable instead.

> We STRONGLY recommend you use a genuine coupler, not an after-market or Chinese clone. Non-genuine Canon and Nikon units have proven themselves erratic in operation, and in some cases refuse to power up the camera altogether. (There's a lot of electronics inside these.)

##  Electronics
#### Arduino Pro Mini 328 

We went with the 3.3V 8MHz model for its minimal current consumption and pin-compatibility with the Pi's 3.3V IO pins. You *will* get better performance out of the 5V version, but also inherit an obligation to add a level converter for the pins (not described here).

    $AUD16</br>
    $USD13

#### FTDI programming cable

Don't be tempted to go with a generic 5V programming cable - stick with a 3.3V version to match the Arduino, otherwise your in-situ programming will result in the Arduino presenting 5V into the 3.3V pins of the Pi.

    $AUD25</br>
    $USD18

#### Raspberry Pi Zero W

I went for the Pi Zero as it met my needs for a low-current, low-cost unit in a small footprint - and less than half the cost of the larger models. There's nothing stopping you upgrading to a Model 2 or 3, but be aware that some of the config options will be slightly different.

#### USB "OTG" cable

You will recognise this as a micro-USB plug to a USB-A socket, but it's officially known as an On-The-Go (OTG) cable. Your Pi supplier probably offers these as an option with the Pi, so you can connect "standard" USB peripherals to the Pi. It's only required in the finished unit if you can't source a single USB cable to run from the camera to the Pi.

#### Mini HDMI cable/adapter

As with the OTG cable, your Pi supplier will surely offer these with the Pi, as you'll need it to connect your desktop monitor for the initial config steps.

#### SanDisk 128GB Ultra Micro SDXC Memory Card

Choosing a larger size allows you to maximise the off-camera storage in the Pi. Be careful though, as once you go over 32G you're beyond the capabilities of the FAT file system and you're at greater risk of finding the Pi won't read the card. I used ["RPi SD cards"](https://elinux.org/RPi_SD_cards) as a helpful reference to find the card we went with here.

    $USD11

#### Coin-cell Backup Battery

The DeadOn RTC requires a 3V lithium backup battery. The common CR1225 or the slightly thinner CR1220 are compatible here. Your DeadOn supplier will probably have these in stock, otherwise they're the sort of item you might get from the local electronics hobby store or key-cutting kiosk.

#### Concealed Timber Door Frame Reed Switch
So as to save opening the case when its in situ, we added a standard door reed switch you might find used in a burglar alarm. Wave a magnet on the outside of the box, and in the configuration presented here it will wake the Raspberry Pi for the previously-set "WakeTime" duration. (This presumes a low-power setup with the Pi normally turned off).

#### 2.5mm stereo socket

This is to connect the intervalm8r to the camera's shutter cable. The PCB has been designed to accommodate all the thru-hole PCB-mounted sockets we could buy online. You could just as easily choose in-line instead, or a directly-connected cable. Change this to a suitable connector if your camera shutter release cable uses a different type. (See ["adding the components"](https://github.com/greiginsydney/Intervalometerator/blob/master/docs/step4-pcb-assembly.md#adding-the-components) in the PCB assembly.md for more details and options.)

#### 3mm Green LED (optional)

As the project is presented, this LED lights when the Arduino is awake, but only if the adjacent jumper is connected (taking Arduino input A0 to ground). I used it as a generic headless debugging aid. You should be able to find this just about anywhere: your Arduino/Pi supplier, local electronics hobby store, etc.

#### Veroboard (alternative PCB)

An alternative to the PCB will be to build the board on Veroboard, aka stripboard. (There's an image of the Veroboard prototype on the [Wiki / history](https://github.com/greiginsydney/Intervalometerator/wiki/History) page.)

#### Resistors

Resistors are used on the board for two purposes. They're either current-limiting the supply to the LEDs (the green one and the 2 optos) or providing pull-up or pull-down assistance to the IO pins. You should be able to find these just about anywhere: your Arduino/Pi supplier, local electronics hobby store, etc.

## Power

#### 12V Sealed lead-acid (SLA) battery
Be careful selecting a battery. The 12V 2.2Ah SLA battery we went with only *just* fits inside the Pelican case.

#### 12V Solar charger

We used this "12V 6A Battery Charging Regulator for Solar Panels".

- [Jaycar Electronics (AU)](https://www.jaycar.com.au/12v-6a-battery-charging-regulator-for-solar-panels/p/AA0348)

Both these are easily sourced on the usual websites.

#### Solar panel

Choose a panel and matching charger to suit your installed environment. If you're lucky enough to have mains power, perhaps omit the panel but retain the battery and charger to sustain the system through any unexpected mains failures.

    $USD21 - 34

#### Miscellaneous

Your choice of solar panel might require some bracing or a bracket in order for it to mount to a pole. For ours we used two lengths of some 2" aluminium angle that we had to hand, resulting in a U-shaped support.

    $AUD15</br>
    $USD10.50

I actually decided that this mount wasn't solid enough for my purpose. Being fairly lightweight, it has the potential to wobble a bit, which we want to avoid. I ended up using a heavy duty L-bracket from the local hardware store instead. A better alternative might be . . .

#### Ram Mounts

If your budget allows for it, check out some of the mounting options in the Ram Mounts range. Their ["C Size" mounts](https://www.rammount.com/search?query=c+size) will take up to a 5kg (~10lb) load.

#### Cable entry gland

You only need two holes in the box - one to let the light in, and another for the power. For the power input, you'll need some sort of gland to provide a water-tight seal.

You should be able to source these from your nearest electrical wholesaler, hobbyist electronics shop, or maybe a marine supplies shop (if you're near water).
